// Asset bytes out of a parsed spec and into Unreal's importers.
//
// A <mesh>, <texture>, <hfield> or <skin> is an ordinary generated element like
// any other, and the spec is complete without any Unreal asset existing. What
// the editor additionally wants is a UStaticMesh or a UTexture2D to preview
// with, and that is what this produces: it walks the spec's asset section,
// resolves each element's `file` against the directories the spec itself
// declares, and hands the bytes to a sink.
//
// It is a pass over the spec rather than a reader callback because the
// resolution it performs -- meshdir and texturedir from <compiler>, relative to
// the file the element came from -- is only decidable once the whole spec is
// in the tree, includes expanded and compiler blocks folded. That is also why it
// can run against a spec nobody parsed: an edited tree collects assets the
// same way.
//
// The importer itself is untouched. This produces (element, name, path, bytes)
// and stops; whether that becomes a UStaticMesh, a VFS entry for a compile, or
// the handshake's ship-list is the sink's business.
